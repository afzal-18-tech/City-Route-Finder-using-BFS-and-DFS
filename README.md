# City Route Finder using BFS and DFS

A small learning project that finds routes between cities in a graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).

This repository contains implementations of graph traversal algorithms to determine whether a path exists between two cities and to return the route when one exists.

## Features
- Find the shortest path (in terms of number of edges) using BFS.
- Explore routes using DFS (recursive or iterative).
- Simple, easy-to-follow code suitable for learning graph traversal.

## Algorithms
- BFS (Breadth-First Search): good for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
- DFS (Depth-First Search): useful for exploring possible paths and backtracking.

## Prerequisites
Install the language runtime or compiler used in the repository:
- Python 3.8+ for Python implementations

Adjust the commands below to match the actual files in this repo (e.g., bfs.py, dfs.py, BFS.java, DFS.cpp).

## Usage â€” Python (example)
1. Clone the repository and change into it:
   - git clone https://github.com/afzal-18-tech/City-Route-Finder-using-BFS-and-DFS.git
   - cd City-Route-Finder-using-BFS-and-DFS
2. Run implementations (example filenames):
   - python3 bfs.py
   - python3 dfs.py

Many implementations accept input as a list of edges or a text file describing the graph. Check the top of the implementation files for exact usage and command-line arguments.



## Example
Input:
- Edges: A-B, B-C, C-D
- Source: A
- Target: D

Output:
- Path found: A -> B -> C -> D

## Notes for the repository owner
If you tell me which language(s) are used and the exact main filenames (for example `bfs.py` and `dfs.py`), I can:
- Update this README with precise run instructions and examples tailored to the code,
- Or add the README file to the repository for you (if you'd like me to commit it, grant write access or tell me to proceed and provide any additional details such as a preferred license).

## License
Add an appropriate license file (for example, MIT) or tell me which license you'd like and I can add it.
